# MBK PCB footprints and plate cutouts

This repo includes PCB footprints and plate cutouts designed by [Nicoles](https://github.com/nicoles).

## Stabilizers

Note that stabilizers are supposed to be north facing (see below). It doesn't matter when keycaps are blanks but to support legends they have to be correctly oriented because the stab stem is slightly vertically off-centered.

## Original repo

The [original repo by Nicoles](https://github.com/nicoles/mbk_footprints) is no longer maintained :( so this one has been created to take over and stay up-to-date in the future.
